## About Guffles

Guffles is an intent-based lead discovery platform that helps sales teams find warm leads by analyzing social media engagement signals. Instead of cold outreach, Guffles identifies people who are actively engaging with content related to products or services you sell.

## Core Features

1. **AI Search** - Describe your ideal customer in plain English. AI finds relevant LinkedIn posts and extracts everyone who engaged. Up to 1,500 leads per search.

2. **Direct Post Analysis** - Found a viral post in your industry? Paste the URL. We extract everyone who liked or commented and enrich with verified emails.

3. **Profile Monitoring** - Add influencers or competitors to monitor. We auto-track who engages with their new posts for 72 hours.

4. **Lead Scoring** - AI analyzes every person who engaged and scores them based on how well they match your ideal buyer profile.

5. **Email Enrichment** - Get verified professional email addresses for leads you want to reach out to.

6. **Export & Integrate** - Export to CSV or sync with HubSpot, Salesforce, and more.
